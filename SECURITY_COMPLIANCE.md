# Security and Compliance Infrastructure

This document outlines the comprehensive security and compliance infrastructure implemented across all cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) for the AI research platform.

## Overview

The infrastructure has been secured with defense-in-depth principles:
- **Network Isolation**: Private VPC/VNet with subnet segregation
- **Access Control**: Security groups, NSGs, and firewall rules with least privilege
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption at rest and in transit
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and threat detection
- **Compliance**: Data governance and regulatory compliance tools

## AWS Security Infrastructure

### Network Security
- **VPC**: Custom VPC (10.0.0.0/16) with 6 subnets across 2 availability zones
  - Public subnets (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24) for NAT gateways
  - ML Training private subnets (10.0.10.0/24, 10.0.11.0/24)
  - Data Storage private subnets (10.0.20.0/24, 10.0.21.0/24)
- **NAT Gateways**: 2 NAT gateways for high-availability internet access from private subnets
- **Security Groups**:
  - `ml_training_sg`: SSH (22), HTTPS (443), TensorBoard (6006), distributed training ports (2000-3000)
  - `sagemaker_endpoint_sg`: HTTPS for API access
  - `data_storage_sg`: NFS (2049) restricted to VPC

### VPC Endpoints
- **Gateway Endpoints**: S3
- **Interface Endpoints**: SageMaker API, ECR API, ECR DKR
- **Benefits**: Private connectivity to AWS services without internet gateway

### Encryption

  - EBS volumes
  - EFS file systems
  - RDS instances (when deployed)

### Monitoring & Compliance

- No direct internet access for compute resources
- Controlled egress through NAT gateways/Cloud NAT

### Encryption Everywhere
- All data encrypted at rest with customer-managed keys
- TLS 1.2+ for all data in transit
- Automatic key rotation (90 days)
- Hardware Security Modules (HSM) backing for key storage

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege for all security groups/firewall rules
- No SSH from internet (use bastion hosts or cloud-native tools)
- Service-to-service communication restricted to necessary ports
- Network policies for Kubernetes workloads

### Monitoring & Incident Response
- Centralized logging for all resources
- Real-time threat detection (GuardDuty, Cloud Armor, DDoS Protection)
- VPC/Network flow logs for traffic analysis
- Compliance monitoring with automated remediation

### Data Governance
- Versioning enabled on all storage
- Lifecycle policies for cost-effective long-term retention
- Public access blocked at storage level
- Data classification and labeling (via tags/labels)

### Identity & Access Management (Not Fully Implemented)
Future enhancements should include:
- Service accounts with minimal permissions
- Managed identities for resource-to-resource authentication
- MFA for human access
- Regular access reviews and credential rotation

## Cost vs Security Trade-offs

### Premium Features Enabled
- **NAT Gateways/Cloud NAT**: ~$100-200/month per gateway for private subnet internet access
- **VPC Endpoints**: ~$10-20/month per endpoint, saves data transfer costs
- **KMS**: ~$1/key/month + $0.03 per 10K operations
- **GuardDuty**: ~$4.60 per million events analyzed
- **Azure Firewall**: ~$1.25/hour (~$900/month)
- **DDoS Protection Standard**: ~$2,944/month
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Storage costs (~$0.50 per GB)

### Security ROI
While security features add 5-10% to infrastructure costs, they provide:
- **Data Breach Prevention**: Average cost of breach: $4.24M (IBM, 2023)
- **Compliance**: Avoid regulatory fines (GDPR up to €20M or 4% revenue)
- **Uptime**: DDoS protection prevents revenue loss from downtime
- **Audit Trail**: Forensics and compliance requirements
